<h2>Cool Thing I'm currently using</h2><br>
<p><i>Wow Tom, what an incredibly vague title, could you be a little more specific?</i> <strong>Absolutely,</strong>lets break this down.</p><br>
    
    <h2>Productivity</h2><br>
    &nbsp;<strong>PushBullet</strong>  <br>
        <p>I should probably preface this by saying that I'm an android guy. Anyway, PushBullet is an awesome app for both android and iOS that does a couple of things. First off, It              allows me to mirror notifications from my phone to my browser. This is extremely handy when I don't have my phone on me, but still want to know who is contacting me. Another           very cool feature is the ability to send files between my computer and phone, or between any devices that are running pushbullet. I can send PDFs, images, links, text files,               and more between these devices also instantly. I can't recommend it enough. </p> <br> <br>
    
    &nbsp;<strong>Mighty Text</strong> <br>
        <p>This is an app I just started using, but in the short time I've had it, I'm loving it. Going off of PushBullet, it gives me the ability to respond to text messages from my              laptop.<i>Alright Tom, this sounds like you're just lazy.</i>I promise you I'm not lazy, but when you're doing work on your laptop, it saves time to just pull up a window              and send a quick reply.</p><br><br>
    &nbsp;<strong>Brackets</strong><br>
        <p>Brackets is a free, open source text editor still in beta testing. I've made the switch over to Brackets from Notepad++ and it's been a good, albeit bumpy transition. I'm              really enjoying Brackets because it offers live edits in the browser, so I can view my edits before pushing them out. Also, highlighting color hex codes gives me a preview              of the color, which is a nice touch. Lastly, it offer javascript debugging tools, which are very helpful.</p>
    
<br>
    <h2>Entertainment</h2><br>
    &nbsp;<strong>Chromecast</strong><br>
        <p>Google's Chromecast is probably one of my most used devices. It's a great tool for streaming from my laptop to my tv, and it has built in support for apps, with more on the            way.Netflix,Hulu,HBO,NHL, all of these and more have built in support for the Chromecast. Meaning my laptop, Galaxy S3, and my Nexus 7 can all use this, an push straight to            my tv. I couldn't think of a better $35 to sepnd, and with the SDK now released, it's value is still on the rise.</p> <br><br>
    
    &nbsp;<strong>Spotify</strong><br>
        <p>Spotify isn't exactly a new thing, but I'm putting it on the list right now anyway. I've recently started using Spotify, and as a student, the value is there for a premium              account. $5/month gets you high quality, commercial free music that you can store locally on your phone or computer. Storing music locally is great for me, because I can                save my data on my cell phone by simple storing music on my sd card.</p>
