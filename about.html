<h2>Hi!</h2>
    
&nbsp;
<p>My name is Tom Esposito, and this is my offical GitHub page. I am a senior at the University of Scranton, graduating in June with a bachelors degree in Media and Information Technology. I'm originally from Northern, NJ, and I will be moving back there once I finish up my schooling. I'm a huge hockey, soccer, and football fan. My favorite teams are the New Jersey Devils, Green Bay Packers, and Liverpool. I should also note that I'm a closet Met's fan. <br> <br>

In my free time, I enjoy spending time with my friends and family, along with finding local ice rinks to play pick-up games of hockey. I also enjoy watching movies, and listening to music. Some of my favorite flicks include Back to the Future, Star Wars, and The Blues Brothers. When it comes to music, I seem to like everything that isn't popular on the radio today: Classic and alternative rock. Some of my favorite artists are the Red Hot Chili Peppers, The Black Keys, Local Natives, and Bruce Springsteen. <br> <br>
    
Please take a look around, and if you have any questions, don't hesitiate to <a href="mailto:me@tomesposito.org">contact me.</a>   </p>

<h2>What does the future hold?</h2></br>
<p>Wow, that's a great question. Well, right after I graduate, I will be heading to Honduras for a week of service through the <a href="http://www.scranton.edu/ministries/international-service-programs/service-outreach.shtml">International Service Program.</a>I'm extremely excited for this trip and I've been preparing for it throughout the semester. Along with my amazing group, we'll be heading down to work at a building site during the morning, and at an orphanage during the afternoon. After the trip, I will continue my job search, as either a front-end web developer, or a business analyst.</p>
